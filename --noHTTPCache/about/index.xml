      <description>We are working hard to develop our first Hardware Cell, in order to prove the validity of our Concept.
In fact, we believe that Hardware Acceleration is going Cloud-Native. So we are building a PoC where a BigData problem is handled in a HW-accelerated platform, thanks to a PaaS approach, in our Cloud-based platform.
This PoC will not only validate a huge innovation, but will also make us a pioneer and a main actor in this new Hardware-Cloud Convergence.</description>
