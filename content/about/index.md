## Q&A
### Who are we?
We are a team of technology enthousiasts, having experience in Information Technology, Electronics, Internet & Cloud Infrastructures, DevOps and Software Design. We have also a very strong partnership with a French security consulting company, that is already making use of our technology, and expanding its activity with us.

### What do we do?
We are building an innovative technology that we believe to push the boundaries and simplify the use of very large Computing power, thanks to a smarter use of FPGA and to a Cloud-Native, MicroServices-based Architecture.

We also perform IT consulting for key account customers in Europe. For our team, our experts provide a very high level of training to the team, covering Cloud, Security, Networks, and DevOps technologies.

### Where are we?
Our office is based in France. But our team is international (France, Canada, Tunisia)

### What did we perform yet?
We have already developed a smart cloud-native and microservices architecture for orchestration of any application/workload over a Kubernetes platform.

Our solution, named TheCell, is capable of orchestrating on-premise and-or private/hybrid/public cloud platform, and even of mixing all of that.

### What didn’t we perform yet?
We are working hard to develop our first Hardware Cell, in order to prove the validity of our Concept.

In fact, we believe that Hardware Acceleration is going Cloud-Native. So we are building a PoC where a BigData problem is handled in a HW-accelerated platform, thanks to a PaaS approach, in our Cloud-based platform.

This PoC will not only validate a huge innovation, but will also make us a pioneer and a main actor in this new Hardware-Cloud Convergence.

### What are we looking for?
We are looking create a team of motivated talents, to work on our new product.

We look also to develop our consulting activity by hiring consultants, to work on our innovative projects for our international customers.
